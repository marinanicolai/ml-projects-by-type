# ðŸ’¡ ML Projects by Type

This repository organizes Machine Learning projects based on the main learning paradigms and additional applied methods.

## 1. âœ… **Supervised Learning**

Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models. It includes two main subtypes:

- **Classification** â€” Predict categorical labels  
  *Examples:* spam detection, image classification, sentiment analysis  
  *Algorithms:* Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, KNN, Naive Bayes

- **Regression** â€” Predict continuous values  
  *Examples:* house price prediction, stock forecasting  
  *Algorithms:* Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, SVR

## 2. ðŸ“Š **Unsupervised Learning**

Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to discover patterns or structure:

- **Clustering** â€” Group similar items (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN)
- **Dimensionality Reduction** â€” Simplify features (e.g., PCA, t-SNE)
- **Association Rule Mining** â€” Find frequent item patterns (e.g., Apriori)

---

## 3. ðŸ§  **Ensemble Learning**

Ensemble learning combines multiple models to improve performance and reduce overfitting.

- **Bagging** â€” e.g., Random Forest  
- **Boosting** â€” e.g., AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting  
- **Stacking** â€” Combine multiple models through a meta-model

*Use case:* Compare accuracy between a single Decision Tree and a Random Forest

## 4. ðŸ“¦ **Recommendation Systems**

Recommenders predict user preferences by learning from historical interactions.

- **Collaborative Filtering** â€” Based on user-item similarity
- **Content-Based Filtering** â€” Based on item attributes
- **Hybrid Models** â€” Combine both methods

*Use case:* Movie or product recommendation using user ratings dataset

---

## 5. ðŸ¤– **Reinforcement Learning**

Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning by interacting with an environment to maximize a reward.

*Examples:* game playing, robotic control, self-driving cars  
*Algorithms:* Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Policy Gradient Methods

Each folder contains a real-world mini-project with its own data, code, and explanation to help understand how each ML type works.
