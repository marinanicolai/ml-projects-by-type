# ðŸ’¡ ML Projects by Type

This repository organizes Machine Learning projects based on the three main learning paradigms:

---

## 1. âœ… **Supervised Learning** 

Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models. It includes two main subtypes:

- **Classification** â€” Predict categorical labels  
  *Examples:* spam detection, image classification, sentiment analysis  
  *Algorithms:* Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees, KNN, Naive Bayes

- **Regression** â€” Predict continuous values  
  *Examples:* house price prediction, stock forecasting, temperature estimation  
  *Algorithms:* Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest, SVR

---

## 2. ðŸ“Š **Unsupervised Learning**

Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data to discover patterns or structure. It includes:

- **Clustering** â€” Group similar items  
  *Examples:* customer segmentation, grouping news articles  
  *Algorithms:* K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering

- **Dimensionality Reduction** â€” Reduce number of features while preserving information  
  *Examples:* data visualization, noise reduction  
  *Algorithms:* PCA, t-SNE, UMAP

- **Association Rule Mining** â€” Discover rules about feature co-occurrence  
  *Examples:* market basket analysis  
  *Algorithms:* Apriori, FP-Growth

---

## 3. ðŸ¤– **Reinforcement Learning**

Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning by interacting with an environment to maximize a reward.

*Examples:* game playing, robotic control, self-driving cars  
*Algorithms:* Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), Policy Gradient Methods

Each folder contains a real-world mini-project with its own data, code, and explanation to help understand how each ML type works.
