## 📂 Project Topics

- ✅ **ANN** – Basic artificial neural networks for tabular data
- ✅ **DNN** – Deep neural networks with multiple hidden layers
- ✅ **CNN** – For image classification and pattern recognition
- ✅ **RNN** – For sequential data like time series and text
- ✅ **Transformers** – Modern NLP models like BERT, GPT
- ✅ **Transfer Learning** – Reusing pretrained models for new tasks
- ✅ **PyTorch vs TensorFlow** – Side-by-side comparison of two leading DL frameworks

Each project includes:
- Notebook with code and explanations
- Diagrams of model architectures
- Visualizations of performance metrics
