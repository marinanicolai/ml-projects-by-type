# ü§ñ Reinforcement Learning

This folder contains a beginner-friendly project to help you understand the fundamentals of **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** ‚Äî a powerful ML paradigm where agents learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment.

## üéÆ Project: CartPole Balancing (OpenAI Gym)

**Goal:**  
Teach an agent to balance a pole on a moving cart using trial and error.

---

## üì¶ Tools & Environment

- **Environment:** `CartPole-v1` from [OpenAI Gym](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/)
- **Algorithm:** Q-Learning (tabular) or Deep Q-Network (DQN)
- **Libraries:** 
  - `gym`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - Optional: `PyTorch` or `TensorFlow` for deep learning

## üîÅ How It Works

1. The agent **observes the current state** (cart position, pole angle, etc.)
2. It **takes an action** (move cart left or right)
3. The environment returns a **reward** (+1 per time step the pole remains upright)
4. The agent **learns** a strategy (called a *policy*) to balance the pole for as long as possible

##  What You‚Äôll Learn

- How RL agents **interact** with environments
- How rewards shape learning via **feedback**
- The concept of **exploration vs. exploitation**
- How to implement **Q-tables** (for simple Q-Learning)
- How to use **neural networks** to estimate Q-values (DQN)

## üìò What is Reinforcement Learning?

> **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of **rewards** and **punishments**, and its goal is to learn a strategy (called a **policy**) that maximizes cumulative reward over time.
